# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Why are there no arrivals at destination terminals?**

   Unfortunately, BART's GTFS-realtime data simply does not provide arrivals for destination terminals.
   I get it; most folks _don't_ stand on the platform at a terminal, looking at the transit app of their choice,
   wondering when the next terminating train will arrive.
   But, it does make life somewhat inconvenient for other kinds of applications where that information would be useful.
   We could use departure delay at the penultimate stop and the scheduled arrival time at the terminal to interpolate
   destination terminal arrivals, and may implement this in the future.

2. **Why don't unscheduled trips appear?**

   At present only scheduled trips are rendered because we would _like_ to have route and direction information for
   each trip, and that is only available by matching real-time and static trips. Of course this can be worked around,
   for example by assigning unscheduled trips to a generic route, and we may do this in the future.

3. **What about eBART?**

   eBART basically poses the same problem as unscheduled trips—the trip IDs for eBART trips don't match those in the
   static GTFS, so we'd have to do a little more processing (which we aren't currently doing) to assign them to a route.

4. **It's too busy!**

   This is what I get for showing both directions at once! But you can click on lines in the legend, or shift-click
   to select multiple lines, and the unselected lines will be faded out.

5. **Are you really telling me Berryessa is in the north?**

   Timetable north, yes.

6. **Why is it called "Data Lake Merritt"?**

   Because BART Headquarters used to be adjacent to Lake Merritt, and...well, okay, [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)
   isn't actually a [data lake](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf), but it's still funny!
